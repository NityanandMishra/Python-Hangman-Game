# Python-Hangman-Game
The classic Hangman game made simple - guess a random word letter by letter using Python. 6 lives to start with, each incorrect guess drawing a bit more of the hangman. ASCII art, restricts duplicates, updates the word display. For people who may be new to python, or just want a quick terminal game.
